<!-- 
    A favicon(Favorite Icon) is a small, typically square icon associated with a website. 
    It is displayed in the browser's address bar, tabs, bookmarks, and sometimes in search results. 
    Favicons serve as a visual representation of a website or web page, making it easier for users to identify and differentiate between 
    multiple open tabs or bookmarks. It is usually 16*16 in size and stored in GIF, PNG, or ICO file formate.
    
Example: 
-->

<head>
    <!-- Other meta tags and links may be present here -->

    <!-- Favicon link -->
    <link rel="icon" type="image/png" href="favicon.png" sizes="32x32">
</head>
