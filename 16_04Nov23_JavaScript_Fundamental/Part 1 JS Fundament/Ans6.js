// Suppose we have age of user is 25

// We can also use "a" to store age, but but, when you have big project then you may forget what is "a"
const a = 25                    // Bad practice


// Here you use "userAge" to store age. So we can easly identify that what is in this variable by reading it's name
const userAge = 25              // Good practice
