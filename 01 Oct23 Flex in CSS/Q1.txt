Q1. Describe the main differeces between the CSS Flexbox layout model and CSS Grid layout model. When
would you choose to use one to over the other?

Ans :

    CSS Flexbox:

        Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout system, which means it deals with either rows or columns, but not both at the same time.

        It is best suited for laying out items in a single direction (either horizontally or vertically).

        Ideal for arranging items in a navigation bar, creating a flexible and dynamic layout for components, or distributing space along a single axis.


    CSS Grid:

        CSS Grid is a two-dimensional layout system that allows you to create complex layouts with rows and columns simultaneously.
        
        It is great for designing overall page layouts where you need to control both the rows and columns.

        Well-suited for creating grid-based designs, such as a magazine-style layout or any design that requires alignment of items in both directions.
