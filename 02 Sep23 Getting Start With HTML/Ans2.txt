Q2. Explain the purpose of comments in HTML and provide an example of how to use comments in an HTML documents.
Ans. 

    Wherever you put comments in your programm, that piece of code will not be render.
    
    Comment is used for understanding code in one look, 
    it also help to other devloper to figure it out "what this piece code does", who is working with you
    So many lines of code can not be easily managed if you don't put comments on it..

    You can add comments by "control + /"

    first you have to select lines then press "control+/"

    You can manually add the comments also in HTML documents by typing this <!-- Comment ---> but this is not good practice.
