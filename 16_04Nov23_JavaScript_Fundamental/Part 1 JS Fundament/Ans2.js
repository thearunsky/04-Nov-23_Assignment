JavaScript (JS) and HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) are two fundamental technologies used in web development, 
but they serve different purposes and are used in different aspects of building a web page. 
Here are the key differences between JavaScript and HTML:

    Nature:

        HTML: 
            HTML is a markup language, not a programming language.
            It consists of a series of tags that define the structure and semantics of the content. 
            HTML documents are static, and their structure doesn't change unless the page is reloaded.

        JavaScript: 
            JavaScript is a full-fledged programming language. 
            It allows developers to write scripts that can perform calculations, manipulate data, and respond to user interactions.

    File Types:

        HTML: 
            HTML files typically have a .html or .htm file extension. 
        
        JavaScript: 
            JavaScript code is often written in separate files with a .js file extension. 


    Purpose:

        HTML :
            HTML is a markup language used for structuring content on the web. 
            It defines the structure of a web page using elements like headings, paragraphs, lists, links, images, and more. 
            HTML provides the basic building blocks for creating the layout and content of a webpage.
        
        JavaScript: 
            JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. 
            It allows developers to create features like form validation, image sliders, and interactive user interfaces.
