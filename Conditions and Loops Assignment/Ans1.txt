Conditional statements in JavaScript are used to make decisions in your code based on certain conditions. 
These statements allow your program to execute different blocks of code depending on whether a specified condition evaluates to true or false. 

    SYNTAX :

        if (condition1) {
            // Code to be executed if condition1 is true

        } else if (condition2) {
            // Code to be executed if condition2 is true
            
        } else {
            // Code to be executed if none of the conditions are true
        }
    
    EXAPMLE :
        let temperature = 25;

        if (temperature > 30) {
            console.log("It's a hot day!");

        } else if (temperature >= 20 && temperature <= 30) {
            console.log("The weather is pleasant.");

        } else {
            console.log("It's cold outside.");
        }
