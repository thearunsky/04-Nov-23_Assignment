/*
JavaScript (JS) is a scripting and object-oriented programming language used by developers to make web pages interactive. 
It allows developers to create dynamically updating content using DOM Manuplation.

    Here are some key aspects of JavaScript and its role in web development:

        Client-Side Scripting: 
            JavaScript is mainly used as a client-side scripting language, it runs on the user's web browser rather than on the server.

        DOM Manipulation: 
            JavaScript can manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM), which represents the structure of an HTML document. 


        Event Handling: 
            JavaScript is used to handle events such as clicks, keypresses, and mouse movements. 
            Developers can define functions that are triggered when these events occur.

        Asynchronous Programming: 
            JavaScript supports asynchronous programming through features like callbacks, promises, and async/await.
        
        Frameworks and Libraries: 
            There are numerous JavaScript frameworks and libraries, such as React, Angular, and Vue.js, 
            that simplify and streamline the development process. 
            These tools provide pre-built components, data-binding, and other features that help developers build scalable and maintainable web applications.
