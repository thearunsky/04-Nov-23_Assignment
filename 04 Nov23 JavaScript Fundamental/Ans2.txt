Q2. Describe the categorization of operators in JavaScript based on their functionality. Provide examples for each category.
Ans. 

Basically oprators are used to declare varibles and constants.
    EXAMPLE : 
        const name = "Arun"
        Here we use equal sign to declare name varible as "Arun"

Operators are also used to compare two or more values.
    EXAMPLE :
        5 == "5"
        Double equal to means we are comparing values, but it do not compare datatype so output will be true.
        
        We have triple-equal(===) to compare datatype as well.
        5 === "5"
        Output will be false.

        ==      equal to
        !=      not equal to
        ===     equal value and type
        !==     not equal value and type
        >       greter than
        <       less than
        >=      greater than and equal to
        <=      less than and equal to



Through operators we can perform arithmatic operations.
    EXAMPLE :
        Addition
            const add = 5 + 9

        Substraction 
            const sub = 9 - 5

        Divition 
            const div = 9/3

        Multiplication 
            const mul = 9 * 5

        Remainder
            const rem = 76 % 5

            it will give us remainder, in this case we get 1 as output

        Exponentiation or Power-Operator
            const power = 2**3
            
            It means 2 * 2 * 2 = 8

Logical operators are used to determine the logic between variables or values.
    EXAMPLE :
        There are three logical oprators. These three oprators are used when we want to compare two or more conditions
            && (and)
            || (or)
            ! (not)

        console.log((5==3) && (9==9))
        Output will be false, because only one condition is true, other condition is false. So false

        console.log((5==3) || (9==9))
        Output will be true, because only one condition is true. So true.

        ! this oprator simply turn (true into false) or (false into true.)

typeof oprator help to find out which operator are you dealing with
    EXAPMLE :
        console.log(typeof 99)
        output will be number

        console.log(typeof "jhjhs")
        output will be string

Ternary oprator assigns a value to a variable based on a condition.
    EXAMPLE :
        (condition) ? true : false

        ((userAge >= 18) ? "Access Granded" : "You are not 18 right now, Sorry ")
