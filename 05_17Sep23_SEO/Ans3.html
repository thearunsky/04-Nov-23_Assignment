    Meta tags are snippets of code that provide information about a webpage to search engines and other software. 
            Here are some of the advantages of using meta tags:

    1.Improved Search Engine Optimization (SEO): 
        Meta tags play a crucial role in SEO. They provide search engines with important information about the content of a webpage, 
        helping them understand what the page is about. This can lead to better rankings in search engine results pages (SERPs).

    2.Title and Description Optimization: 
        The meta title and meta description tags allow you to define the title and description that appear in search results. 
        This gives you control over how your page is presented to users in search listings, influencing click-through rates.

    3.Enhanced User Experience: 
        Well-crafted meta tags can provide users with a clear and accurate preview of the content on a webpage. 
        This can lead to higher click-through rates and lower bounce rates, indicating a positive user experience

    4.Security and Authentication: 
        Meta tags like Content-Security-Policy and X-Frame-Options can be used to enhance the security of a webpage by specifying 
        which resources are allowed to be loaded and how the page can be embedded in other sites
