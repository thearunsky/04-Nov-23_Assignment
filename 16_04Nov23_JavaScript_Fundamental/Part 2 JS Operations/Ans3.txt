Q3. Differentiate between unary, binary, and ternary operators in JavaScript. Give examples of each.

Ans. 
We can also categories the operators based on how much operands they need to operate.

Unart Operators : This operators accept one operand.
    EXAPMLE : 
        console.log(9++)                // 10
        console.log(++9)                // 10

        --7
        7--

        console.log(typeof 99)          // number
        

Binary Operator : This operators accept two operand.
    EXAMPLE :
        arithmatic operators (+,-,/,*,%)
            console.log(8+6)                        // 14

        rational operators (<,>,<=,>=,==,===)
            console.log(8>6)                        // true

        logical operators (%%,||)
            console.log(true || false)              // false

        assignment operators (+=,-=,/=,*/)
            let a = 8
            a+=7

            console.log(a)                          // 15

Turnary Operator(conditional operators) : This operator accept three operand.
        EXAMPLE :
            (condition) ? true : false

            ((userAge >= 18) ? "Access Granted" : "You are not 18 right now, Sorry ")
