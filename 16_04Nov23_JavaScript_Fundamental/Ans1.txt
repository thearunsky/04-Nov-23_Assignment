Q1. Explain the role of operators in JavaScript. Why are they essential in programming?
Ans. 

    Operators are very important in any programming language and they help us take decisions based on certain conditions. 
    Suppose we want to combine the result of two conditions, 
    then logical AND and OR logical operators help us in producing the final result.

    Operators are very usefull for us when we validate something, 
    like user's age should not less than 18, so we use >=(greater than equal to) oprator according to conditions..
    like user's phone number should not greter than 10 digits, so we use <=(less than equal to) oprator according to conditions.
    So, Here operators are very essential for programming.
